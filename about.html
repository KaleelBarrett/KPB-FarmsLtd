          Our Story: Founded in 2017, KPB Farms was born out of a deep
          appreciation for the rich bounty that nature offers and a desire to
          connect farmers directly with consumers. We realized that there was a
          need to bridge the gap between the farm and the table, ensuring that
          everyone can enjoy the benefits of fresh, wholesome produce without
          compromising on quality.
        </p>

          from these passionate farmers, we can guarantee that you receive
          produce that is grown with care, without the use of harmful chemicals
